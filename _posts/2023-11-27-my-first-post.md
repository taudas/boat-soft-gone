I opened the box on my new BeagleV-Fire.
There was a card inside with a quick start url.
Except the docs website is incomplete - as in no information at all.

so here are the important points:
user beagle
password temppwd

when attached by usb, BeagleV-Fire will load and run and multicast dns
address beaglev.local


Example with image:

![Error](@@baseUrl@@/assets/images/posts/error.png)

Example ssh command:

```js

ssh beagle@beaglev.local

```
